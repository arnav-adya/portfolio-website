                <h4> Microsoft Office Systems and Procedures </h4>
                <p>
                  During my time in Business Professionals of America (BPA), I have gained valuable soft skills such as teamwork and communication through group events such as Website Design Team and Web Application Team through presentations. But, through my individual event, Office Systems and Procedures, I learned how to effectively use Microsoft applications such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. I took this skill and applied it to my internship at Microsoft and my student program with NASA. Microsoft Office, overall, has been very beneficial to me.

                <h4> Programming &amp; Website Development </h4>
                <p>
                  Throughout high school, I have learned how to program not only games and simple codes, but also websites. For the simple codes, like calculators and number guessing games, I used Java. Then, I started using Python to incorporate AI chatbots to create artificial intelligence algorithms that could do things like diagnose patients based on their symptoms and let people know whether an item is recyclable or not. I also used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create various different websites for different competitions and my own personal needs.

                <h4> Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360 </h4>
                <p>
                  In my engineering class during my sophomore year, PLTW Intro to Engineering and Design, I learned and strengthened my skills in 3D design using Autodesk Inventor. Then, I used those skills and transferred them to my 6 month program with NASA. In this course, I designed and modeled different small objects, such as tools for astronauts, and practiced creating  objects like Lego bricks using Autodesk Fusion 360. Then, during the Moonshot program after this course, I designed and modeled a Mars/Lunar rover equipped with a variety of tools and sensors for exploration using mainly Autodesk Inventor to model and assemble the rover.

                <h4> Arduino and Circuitry </h4>
                <p>
                  Also, during my engineering class, we learned how to use all of the things we learned to create our final project. In this project, we included all of the simple machines such as gears, pulleys, and levers to create a functional and efficient elevator and also included VEX robotics to program the elevator floor to move up and down. We also used circuitry to program a light showing the elevator's current position. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of engineering principles and hands-on skills in a practical setting within a limited amount of time, while also enhancing my understanding of mechanical systems and robotics.
